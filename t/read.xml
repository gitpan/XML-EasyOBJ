			<NOTES>King Chenchun was watching the workers beautify Lauria City. When a young man told him there was exciting news down at the docks. Men had arrived with the head of King Jarimor. This was exciting news for King Chenchun, so he raced to the docks. There he was met by the men. They said they were envoys of Vruda. "We took our army to investigate hereitc rumblings to the north. There we observed what we thought to be rituals of Tarq. As the only good follower of Tarq is a dead follower, we killed them all. Then we rumaged through their belongings and found relics of Elbar. So we came here with the head of King Jarimor to claim the reward. King Jarimor is dead, long live the Old Church."  KIng Chenchun was very happy. "Lets open some corn ale and toast this victory" The men looked at the king and said "show us the way to the ale." The King, knowing that all Vrudanesse sailors always carry plenty of corn ale in ther ships, and never drink from other peoples kegs. He killed them. " FIND ME KING JARIMOR!!!!!!!!"    Duke Pelara looked in the region of Morwen. He found some shady characters, but the killed as a message to keep away from the local underworld, not because they were Tarq spies. His home region of Dumaria, scared by the underworld, distanced themselves from the king. Duke Mulwar found nothing in Mittfel. Duke Krellius was looking in the region of Encora when he found a rather odd item. A helm of strange design. He placed it on his head and was consumed by flame. A local peasent carefully transported the helm to King Chenchun.</NOTES>

As the deadline for peace approached, it became apparent that the Duke was willling to deal. Tensions throught the lands of Tarsha were high, when at the last moment, Doran announced that an agreement had been reached with the Duke. Gistel would withdraw from Velsen. The nations of Chu-Lon,Tearsh,Sonlar,Norta and Gistel would also sign a mutual defense compact known as the Island Defense Agreement or IDA.    This settled, the Chief Elder had time to concentrate on other matters. He placed a HUGE bounty on the head of King Jarimor of Elbar. Any nation that discovers, reports the location of and aids in the destruction of the fugitive nation will benefit handsomely.</NOTES>

" Would it not be better if the Orcs were carying our clubs instead of trying to hit us with clubs?" So he went in search of orcs. He found some, and realized it was a bad idea. Clarke was intrigued by the books the King was reading, who grew annoyed at someone reading over his shoulder, so he gave him his own book. Neither one learned anything usefull.</NOTES>

With joy he saw the seeker people emmbraace the Path. He was able to build religious sites on the island. Once in a while Bishop Toben woul;d send a message to the Prime Seeker about the activities on the Western Front. The people of Zrjpe and Gistel were looking forward to the marriage of the princess Moria. She was to be wed in the region of Zrjpe in the year 226 S.C. Toben was excited as this was one of the few chances he would have to proside over a royal function. He sought out the people of Gistel to assist them in the signing of the Island Defense Pact. Then he let his wonderings take him to the region of Dovai, where he found the Church of  the Anhk. Some young priests were sent to Faldo in hopes that they would consider changing their pagan ways to Seek the True Path.</NOTES>

			<NOTES>King Norton built a mages guild  around the shrine to the Old Church that he had built back in 223 S.C. The shrine itself was also expanded. It looks as if the shrine could engulf the abbey that exsists there.  It is noted by many that the shrine generates a healthy feeling in all who spend time there. This could be true, or just a feeling-only the gods know for sure. King Norton prolcaimed "Long live the Old Church"</NOTES>

			<NOTES>King Francis was very worried. "No tax revenue, no tax revenue. How will I pay my military. I must get those tax collectors motivated. I know, I'll kill one of them. That will get the others in line. " Then he called in his favorite Captain. " The treasury lacks the money to pay the troops."   "Well Sire, just make sure they are well fed, and maybe most will wait."  "Oh, thats it, we will sell off the surplus grain, Yes,Yes, ohhhhhh Yes" And thus, a national disaster was avoided. Arthur "two sheds" Jackson was sent to Pohi to increase loyalty in the region. Tim "the enchanter" secured the loyalty of Tilos. In Ye a rather strange thing happened. The leader of the region went completly mad and had to be locked in his bedchambers in his castle for the rest of his life ... chewing on pillows and screaming about the "swine horde of the north". His eldest son Delores (he really wanted a girl) took over the day to day business of Ye for him.</NOTES>

The ally from Buzau was sent to explore the land. In Athes he found Orcs, so the rest of his plans were cancelled. The ally from Serry was sent out to gather slaves. He was rather taken by the looks of one of the young women in Hulst. As it turned out she did not appreciate his interest. She killed him in his sleep. The region of Serry felt now was a good time to distance themselves from the Vale.</NOTES>
