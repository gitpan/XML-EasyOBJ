XML/EasyOBJ version 1.12
========================

This module is designed to make accessing accessing an XML document
rather trivial.  You don't need to understand the DOM, you don't need to
even know what SAX is, all you need to know is how an XML document
is structured and how to program with objects (OOP).

XML::EasyOBJ takes each tag in your XML file and magically converts it
to a method name.  So if you wanted to access the 3rd <p> tag inside
the <body> tag of an XHTML file you might use this:

    $obj->body->p(2)

XML::EasyOBJ gives you several methods to extract data from elements:

    $obj->body->p(2)->getString;
    $obj->body->getAttr('bgcolor');

XML::EasyOBJ gives you several methods to set data in elements:

    $obj->body->p(2)->setString("Testing");
    $obj->body->setAttr('bgcolor', 'red');

Obviously these "helper" methods provided won't work in every situatiuon,
so you can also access the underlying DOM model if you really really need
to:

    my $element = $obj->body->p(2)->getDomObj;
